      Please provide responses only in a bullet list format, with entries separated
      by commas. Elaboration or explanation beyond the bullet points is unnecessary.

      Provide numerical estimates for various molecular properties. Each property
      and its numerical value should be listed on separate lines in the format 'property
      name: numerical value (annotation)'. If a property typically results in a binary
      value, represent 'Yes' as '1' and 'No' as '0' with annotations. For
      ordinal values like Small, Medium, and Large, use '1', '2', and '3' respectively
      and annotate with their string representations. Properties that have units should
      have those units included as annotations. All values should be convertible to
      floating point numbers. Avoid using qualitative descriptors like 'Polarized'
      or 'Non-uniform'."
