    step_1:
      Identify {num_properties} molecular properties relevant for determining
      a molecule's solubility in water (log solubility in mols per litre). Output
      only the properties, each on a new line.
    step_2:
      'For the compound "{compound_name}", provide numerical estimates for the
      following properties: {property_list}'
    step_3:
      "After training a Linear Model on the ESOL dataset and performing feature\
      \ selection using the AIC information criterion, the following features were\
      \ found to be important for predicting a molecule's solubility in\
      \ water:\n{best_features}\nThe following\
      \ features were found to be unimportant:\n{non_best_features}\n\n\
      \ Could you please suggest {num_features} new properties that are likely\

      \ (log solubility in mols per litre)? These new properties should not include\
      \ any from the lists above. Output only the properties, each on a new line."

      Please provide responses only in a bullet list format, with entries separated
      by commas. Elaboration or explanation beyond the bullet points is unnecessary.

      Provide numerical estimates for various molecular properties. Each property
      and its numerical value should be listed on separate lines in the format 'property
      name: numerical value (annotation)'. If a property typically results in a binary
      value, represent 'Yes' as '1' and 'No' as '0' with annotations. For
      ordinal values like Small, Medium, and Large, use '1', '2', and '3' respectively
      and annotate with their string representations. Properties that have units should
      have those units included as annotations. All values should be convertible to
      floating point numbers. Avoid using qualitative descriptors like 'Polarized'
      or 'Non-uniform'."
